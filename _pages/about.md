Student of Computing Engineering and M.Sc. Student in Computer Science at [Computer Science Department (DCC)](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/dcc), [Universidad of Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/), Santiago.

My research interests include software engineering, quality assurance and testing of embedded systems for space applications.

Since 2020, I am a M.Sc. student at University of Chile working with Alexandre Bergel on the study of the systematic application of fuzz testing techniques in the [SUCHAI flight software](https://gitlab.com/spel-uchile/suchai-flight-software). Also, I continue working as a developer and researcher at [SPEL](https://spel.cl/) in the current missions of the SUCHAI nanosatellite program: PlantSat, SUCHAI II and SUCHAI III.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
