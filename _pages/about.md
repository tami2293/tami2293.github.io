Student of Computing Engineering and M.Sc. Student in Computer Science at [Computer Science Department (DCC)](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/dcc), [University of Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/), Santiago.

My research interests include software engineering, quality assurance and testing of embedded systems for space applications.

Since 2020, I am a M.Sc. student at University of Chile working with Alexandre Bergel on the study of systematic applications of fuzz testing techniques in the [SUCHAI flight software](https://gitlab.com/spel-uchile/suchai-flight-software). Also, I continue working as a developer and researcher at [SPEL](https://spel.cl/) in the current missions of the SUCHAI nanosatellite program: PlantSat, SUCHAI II and SUCHAI III.
